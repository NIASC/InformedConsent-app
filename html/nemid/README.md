TU Services demo for PHP
========================

The demo uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) composer to manage dependencies. Before you run the demo, you need to update its dependencies:

    composer update --prefer-dist
    
Now the demo can be run using you preferred PHP container (nginx, Apache, IIS etc). Note, that PHP >= 5.6.x is required.
